This project completed a basic photo manipulation program in Java! The project contains basic photo manipulation algorithms, such as load new image, save image, undo, quit, “RotateCW”, and “RotateCCW”, more advanced manipulations, like adding border, pixel transformations, Alpha-Blend, contrast, reduced color palette, blurring, and Vignette, and super-fancy photo effects controlled by bottons on the right side of the application (“1890s”, “Pin Hole”, "Zombie", "Plastic", etc.)
